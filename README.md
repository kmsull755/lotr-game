# lotr-game

This is a text-based choose-your-own adventure game based on my favorite fantasy epic, Lord of the Rings. This is a purely 
recreational exercise. I own none of the characters or locations and claim none of the ideas used in this game.

I created this game as a personal challenge on both the creative and technical sides. Not only is the Lord of the Rings universe 
expansive, but it is also difficult to summarize. Despite knowing quite a bit about Tolkein's universe, I found myself scouring over maps of Middle Earth to discover 
locations each character would interact with on their journey and re-reading both the Lord of the Rings series and the other books
of lore Tolkein wrote. I sincerely hope you enjoy the little of the game I've written so far.
